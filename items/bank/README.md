# Bank

All items that will be [given away](../giveaways.md) or [deposited into casino games](../casino.md) must be inside the bank. The bank is a 3rd party inventory that facilitates all item exchanges except trading and black market. Any items won from a casino game or giveaway, will be transferred into your bank.

Items can be transferred in and out of your bank easily. There is no limit to the number of items that can be stored in the bank, nor is there a limit to the number of items exchangeable per transfer.
