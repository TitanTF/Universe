# Break the Safe

Added in [Patch 2.0.53](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/titantf/discussions/11/1732087824985810792/), it was to build on the potential of a massive ARG in 2017, called "Break the Safe".

Everyone can guess the PIN by paying 5 lucky coins. The base safe contains $1,000 and increases by $100 to $200 every 1 hour. It increases by $5 for every failed attempt.

{% hint style="success" %}
What happens when it is OPENED by someone? The person who manages to open it secures all the loot inside the safe.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
What happens when it is NOT OPENED? The safe explodes when it reaches $50,000 and spawns a new one which resets the value back to $1,000.
{% endhint %}
