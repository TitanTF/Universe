# Jackpot

The first ever game introduced was Jackpot. Players can deposit any amount of credits to enter the pot, and the winner takes the entire pot home.

The higher the amount deposited by a player, the higher the chance they have to win the pot. The pot starts picking the winner 15 seconds after there are at least 2 players in the pot. The pot resets its timer back to 15 seconds when another player joins the pot.
