# Battle Pass

First introduced in the Killing Camp update, a battle pass allows for a new way of earning items rather than paying for them.

Through progressively completing daily quests and leveling up, players are able to level up their battle pass to earn items throughout a battle pass.

## Tour of Destruction Battle Pass

A special battle pass that does not feature any items, and only Acrylic weapons and Winter 2018 chests. The weapons earned increases in size when the battle pass leveled up.
