# Black Market

The black market is a global exchange market within the in-game economy where players can sell their items for any price they want, or buy items from the market for possibly a cheaper price than what the shop offers.

### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/limit.png) Limits

You can only sell your items for less than 2X of the original item price. This does not apply to items with no value.

### Market Listings

You can track the items you have listed on the black market, and take them down anytime you would like if you changed your mind.
