# Giveaways

Added [Patch 2.0.57](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/titantf/discussions/11/1732087825004268880/), giveaways are introduced to allow anyone to host a giveaway for any titan.tf items. 

Each giveaway can only have 1 winner, and only the winner of a giveaway will be notified of the results through notifications.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Items must be transferred from the inventory into the [bank](bank/) in order to deposit items into web-based casino games.
{% endhint %}

## Settings

The length of a giveaway can be set with a maximum of up to 4 months. A limit to the maximum number of entries allowed can be set, but there is no cap to this number.

{% hint style="info" %}
If there should be open to an unlimited number of people, the number 0 can be used instead.
{% endhint %}

There is no limit to the number of items, nor the total value of items a giveaway can contain.
