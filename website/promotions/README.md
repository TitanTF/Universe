# Promotions

Introduced in [Patch 2.0.50](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/titantf/discussions/11/1739968490569738631/), users can start using promotion codes to receive rewards. Promotion codes can only be used once for every Titan account.

**A promotion code is hidden on this platform, find it!**
