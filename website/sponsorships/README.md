# Sponsorships

![](../../.gitbook/assets/sponsorship.png)

The number of views the video submitted currently has, will determine the sponsorship you will receive. The calculation rates are detailed further below. Each video will only have 1 payout, meaning you cannot request for a sponsorship twice per video.
