# Chat Prefixes

Chat prefixes appear in front of a player's name when they send a chat message to the server. This can be changed by going to [settings](https://titan.tf/settings).

This is the list of chat prefixes available:

* Levels
* Level Tiers
* Rank
* Money
* Gems
* Kills
* Kill-Death Ratio

{% hint style="info" %}
If you can't choose one, you can select the "Random" option to randomize to a different prefix for every message. If you do not want to use this feature, you can turn it off by setting it to "None".
{% endhint %}
