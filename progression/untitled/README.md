# Experience Points

Experience Points, also known as XP or EXP in short, can earned by playing on any of the community servers.

The amount of experience earned is determined by a variety of factors such as event multipliers. The experience points will be awarded immediately when the event is detected to occur.

## Double XP Fridays

It is a weekly automated global event that occurs on every Friday. Players who play during the event will gain twice the experience points awarded to them.

#### Friday Multiplier

In addition to Double XP Fridays, if you have **titan.tf** in your name, you will receive an additional 2X experience points boost.

## &lt; 5 Players

You will receive a bonus 2X XP if there are less than 5 players on the server you are playing on.

## TWILIGHT Hours

All XP and Gems earned is quadrupled by 4X when playing from 12 AM to 9 AM on any day.

## Bonus

Server Seeding A server seeding event activates when a server has less than 6 players \(or less than 4 players in Mann vs Machine or Machine Attacks\). This event is activated to award players who seed the server.

Seeding is where one joins an empty server and attract other players to join. A player is more likely to join a server with someone in it rather than joining an empty one.
