It was first proposed by myst to develop this gamemode. The gamemode was inspired from ArraySeven's Bowling For Medics video released on February 3, 2017.

### Development

myst developed the gamemode plugin.

x3Karma did the designing for the structure of the map and developed it until the end of the alpha phase.

Brad took over to complete the detailing of the map and developed it to version 4.

Sretzo took over the whole project by redesigning the entire level from scratch and developed it to release candidate 1.

### Open Source

The team at Titan have open sourced the project, allowing anyone to create new maps and improve the gamemode.
