# Web-Game Integration

### Status Detection

We are able to detect whether you are currently playing, which server you are playing on, and whether you are browsing our website. We use this to display it on player profiles, and the list of currently online players on the home page.

### Loadouts

When you update your loadout through the MOTD browser in a game, we automatically refresh your loadout by refetching your loadout again. The changes you make on the website loadout are automatically reflected in the game.
