# Automated Season Events

There are many wonderful seasons over every year, for example spooky Halloween and joyful Christmas.

In order to create an atmosphere that strikes you the vibes of the season, we went ahead to modify some gameplay features to fit the theme.

These features are automatically enabled during each season.

## April Fools

For the lols.  
**1 April - 8 April \(7 days\)**

### Supply Drop

This is a special drop that is unique to this event. A bomb will randomly appear on the map. This bomb will detonate and annihilate everyone on the map if it is not destroyed within 5 minutes.
