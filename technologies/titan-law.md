# Titan Law

Titan Law is a powerful framework that a few features build upon. A law enforces a rule, and we think the name really fits as the systems we code a rule for has to abide it.

Currently, both quests and challenges use the Titan Law framework. In addition, we have an unannounced project which will also be powered by Titan Law in the near future. Three different systems will be powered by Titan Law.
