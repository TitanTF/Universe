# Last To Leave

### A brand new automated event is coming soon.

When a server reaches the maximum players \(for e.g. 24/24 or 32/32\) it can hold, the event will activate. The last person who leaves the server after the event is activated will win **$10,000**.

Anyone can still join the server and leave at any time during the event. This only activates on non Mann vs Machine servers.

In the event that the map changes, the event will reset.
