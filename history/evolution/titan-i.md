# Titan I

When we started, we hosted 1 game server right from home and it wasn't possible to keep it up and running for 24 hours a day. The idea originally came from wanting to bring Mann vs Machine x10 servers to the Asia region as there were none back then. x10 servers were really popular then and they were the reason why we loved the game.

We added tons of wacky and crazy stuff over time. This garnered us a lot of attention and had allowed us to become a very popular Mann vs Machine server.

The eras before Titan 2 is also known as Titan 1.

**While the exact founding date of titan.tf is unknown, but it is generally assumed to be the same date as the Steam group's creation in 2015.**
