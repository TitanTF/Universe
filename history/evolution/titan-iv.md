# Titan IV

This update brought massive fixes to changes that were carelessly made in Titan III. The concept they were trying to keep in mind was still to be unique. They started off making a Free-for-All Hightower Deathmatch server but it never really got popular, so they scrapped it off the list. They then started introducing Hightower, followed by Orange, and these are very welcomed by players in Asia. After that, we worked on Deathrun. The Deathrun server has a heavily modified version of Deathrun Redux, to follow the Vs Saxton Hale Deathrun concept but without the need to download massive amounts of models so that players can join the server quick, but still overall, the plugin many more fixes to come.
