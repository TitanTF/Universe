# Titan III

Massive improvements were brought based on Titan II. Menus were improved and chats displayed more relevant content. This is also when they had enough funds to host more servers that were providing better latency and available 24 hours every day, thanks to our dedicated players who kept playing and supporting the server. There were a lot of gamemodes planned for the future, but we started off with 11 Mann vs Machine servers.

From there, we collected even more funds to host a fast download server that has unlimited bandwidth, which meant that they could start to host more maps for gamemodes of all types.
